### 引言
### Introduction

对变化、动态及因果关系的评估，是思考与阐释的核心。理解，就是要知晓**何种因引发何种果、通过何种方式、以何种速率**。那么，这类知识该如何呈现呢？

Assessments of change, dynamics, and cause and effect are at the heart of thinking and explanation. To understand is to know what cause provokes what effect, by what means, at what rate. How then is such knowledge to be represented?

本书介绍了一种设计策略——即图像、文字与数字在时空维度的合理排布——用于呈现关于运动、过程、机制及因果的信息。这些策略在各类阐释性描述中反复出现，与具体的实质内容或展示技术无关。

This book describes design strategies—the proper arrangement in space and time of images, words, and numbers—for presenting information about motion, process, mechanism, cause and effect. These strategies are found again and again in portrayals of explanations, quite independent of the particular substantive content or technology of display.

我们也将踏入阐释的认知乐园：这是一个鲜活而丰富的世界，与信息设计密切相关。发现阐释方法的人，往往也是构建其呈现形式的人。比如：1633年，罗伯特·伯顿设计《忧郁的解剖》的标题页，以呼应书中复杂的论证（霍布斯在《利维坦》中也做了类似设计）；1659年，克里斯蒂安·惠更斯不仅发现了土星环，还清晰地绘出了自己的发现；1854年，约翰·斯诺找出了终结流行病的证据，且巧妙地呈现了这些证据；理查德·费曼为量子电动力学开发了时空图，同时也分析了“挑战者号”航天飞机发射这一灾难性决策中涉及的证据呈现方式；数世纪以来，魔术师们先是设计出因果错觉，再反过来解释错觉的制造技巧；阿德·莱因哈特在作品中呈现精妙的色彩，同时也通过敏锐的漫画讲解现代艺术风格。所有这些机智的创造者与发现者，都示范了知识的呈现、描述、阐释乃至构建的方法。

And we also enter the cognitive paradise of explanation, a sparkling and exuberant world, intensely relevant to the design of information. Those who discover an explanation are often those who construct its representation. Thus we see Robert Burton in 1633 who designs the title page of *The Anatomy of Melancholy* so as to reflect the book’s elaborate argument (as did Hobbes in *Leviathan*); Christian Huygens in 1659 not only detecting the rings of Saturn but also luminously picturing his discoveries; John Snow in 1854 finding the evidence needed to end an epidemic and skillfully presenting that evidence; Richard Feynman developing space-time diagrams for quantum electrodynamics and also reasoning about the display of evidence involved in the disastrous decision to launch the space shuttle *Challenger*; magicians for centuries contriving illusions about cause and effect and then explaining techniques of illusion production; Ad Reinhardt in presenting exquisitely subtle colors in his work and also teaching about styles of modern art with perceptive and droll cartoons. All these quick-witted creators and discoverers demonstrate methods by which to represent, describe, illustrate, and, indeed, construct knowledge.

我们的诸多案例表明：思维的清晰与卓越，和数据展示的清晰与卓越极为相似。当设计原则复刻思维原则时，信息排布的行为就成了洞见的行为。

Many of our examples suggest that clarity and excellence in thinking is very much like clarity and excellence in the display of data. When principles of design replicate principles of thought, the act of arranging information becomes an act of insight.

本书第一部分探讨呈现量化证据的逻辑：指导数据展示设计的原则是什么？这些原则从何而来？面对复杂且动态的数据呈现形式，如何保持量化描述的完整性？评估视觉证据（尤其是用于决策与得出结论的视觉证据）的标准是什么？

The first part of this book examines the logic of depicting quantitative evidence. What principles should inform our designs for showing data? Where do those principles come from? How can the integrity of quantitative descriptions be maintained in the face of complex and animated representations of data? What are the standards for evaluating visual evidence, especially for making decisions and reaching conclusions?

第二部分探讨设计策略，通常涉及图像的叙事性排布。这部分的议题更偏向视觉性（甚至抒情性），而非量化性。核心思路是打造能提升阐释**丰富度**的设计，通过内容的复杂性、清晰度、维度性与明确性，拓展纸张、视频及电脑屏幕的视觉承载能力，我们得以深化自身的知识与经验。因此，本书的这一部分将介绍用于对比与叙事的架构：平行结构、多元呈现、复合设计。

The second part considers design strategies, often for the arrangement of images as narrative. Here the issues are more visual—and lyrical—than quantitative. The idea is to make designs that enhance the richness, complexity, resolution, dimensionality, and clarity of the content. By extending the visual capacities of paper, video, and computer screen, we are able to extend the depth of our own knowledge and experience. And so this part of the book reports on architectures of comparison and narrative: parallelism, multiples, confections.

书中若干插图已进行编辑与重绘（引文部分会注明），目的是修复破损的原作、制作新的分色版，以及优化设计。所有变体设计的原始素材（即我的创作主题）都会明确标注来源。

Several of the illustrations have been edited and redrawn (as noted in the citations) in order to repair battered originals, to make new color separations, and to improve the design. Primary sources—the themes for my variations—are always indicated.

我的三本信息设计类书籍关联如下：

- 《量化信息的视觉呈现》聚焦“数字的图像”，讲解如何呈现数据并确保统计的真实性。

- 《信息的视觉化构建》围绕“名词的图像”展开（比如地图与航拍照片，本质是大量“名词”的平面排布），同时探讨设计的视觉策略：色彩、分层与交互效果。

- 《视觉化阐释》则是关于“动词的图像”，涉及机制与运动、过程与动态、因果关系、阐释与叙事的呈现。由于这类展示常被用于推导结论与制定决策，内容与设计的完整性便成了重点关切。

My three books on information design stand in the following relation:

- The *Visual Display of Quantitative Information* is about pictures of numbers, how to depict data and enforce statistical honesty.

- *Envisioning Information* is about pictures of nouns (maps and aerial photographs, for example, consist of a great many nouns lying on the ground). *Envisioning* also deals with visual strategies for design: color, layering, and interaction effects.

- *Visual Explanations* is about pictures of verbs, the representation of mechanism and motion, of process and dynamics, of causes and effects, of explanation and narrative. Since such displays are often used to reach conclusions and make decisions, there is a special concern with the integrity of the content and the design.

这些书本身就是“自我例证”的：书籍载体本身就体现了书中所写的理念。受优质信息展示的优雅与精准之美启发，也因“自我例证”这一理念的触动，我最终完成了这三本书的撰写、设计与出版。

These books are meant to be self-exemplifying: the objects themselves embody the ideas written about. Enchanted by the beauty of the best displays of information, and also elegant and precise of self-exemplification, I have come to write, design, and publish the three books myself.
